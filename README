    Notes
    -----

    ProjectCenter 0.3.5 does NOT compile on Mac OS X due to some GNUstep
    specific code snippets. Please try the current code from CVS if you
    are interested in using ProjectCenter on Mac OS X. 

    We try to make the next release compile on this platform out of the box 
    again.
