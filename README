    A lot is still not done and not even designed. As for the moment the
    application can be used for creating and managing projects of different
    kinds, such as GORM applications, libraries, tools and so on.

    What still needs a lot of effort:

    o Code editing/external editor support
    o Debugging
    o Code 'wizards' 
    o UML case tool?!
    o Overall code improvements and bug fixes!!!
    o ... and a lot more!
