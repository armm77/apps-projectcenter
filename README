    Status
    ------

    A lot is still not done and not even designed. As for the moment the
    application can be used for creating and managing projects of different
    kinds, such as GORM applications, libraries, tools and so on.

    What still needs a lot of effort:

    o Code editing/external editor support
    o Debugging support
    o Code 'wizards' 
    o UML case tool?!
    o Overall code improvements and bug fixes!!!
    o ... and a lot more!


    ProjectCenter.app on Mac OS X
    -----------------------------

    It is possible to compile and run ProjectCenter on Mac OS X 10.2 using 
    Cocoa. But since the application relies on the GNUstep makefile package 
    it will not be really useable (yet). 

    Installation: - Compile PCLib and install it in ~/Library/Frameworks/
                  - Compile ProjectCenter.app and install it at the usual place
                  - Compile all bundles and install them where appropriate
                  - Run ProjectCenter.app and set the bundle path in the 
                    preferences panel
                  - Restart ProjectCenter.app - that's it!

    Known issues: - The GUI is hardcoded therefore it is not adopted to Mac OS X
                    metrics.
