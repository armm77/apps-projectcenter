Installing `ProjectCenter'
=========================

ProjectCenter requires GNUstep to be installed. Make sure that you have an
up to date version on your system installed! 

In order to use apps built with ProjectCenter, you will need at least a 
version not older than from October 2000.

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

GNUstep:	
		cd ProjectCenter
		make install

		If you want to do make; make install, make sure that you
		first make; make install PCLib, and *then* the rest of the
		sources!

In order to do this successfully you must first install PCLib and the bundles and then the application itself!

Important!
==========

o ProjectCenter now installs into GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR. Be sure to have the 
  correct privileges when installing it!

o When ProjectCenter fails to launch due to a missing bundle path, you can set 
  it using GNUstep's defaults tool ie. to:

  defaults write ProjectCenter BundlePaths /usr/GNUstep/Local/Library/ProjectCenter
