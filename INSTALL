Installing `ProjectCenter'
====================

ProjectCenter requires GNUstep to be installed. Make sure that you have an
up to date version on your system installed! In order to use apps built with
ProjectCenter, you will need at least a version not older than from October 
2000.

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

GNUstep:	make install;

		If you want to do make; make install, make sure that you
		first make; make install PCLib, and *then* the rest of the
		sources!

In order to do this successfully you must first install PCLib and the bundles and then the application itself!
