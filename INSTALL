Installing `ProjectCenter'
====================

   The ProjectCenter tool runs on OpenStep 4.2 and GNUstep. It's
possible it will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

   Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:


OPENSTEP 4.2:	make; make install 

		(or open the project in PB.app and compile it from there)

GNUstep:	make; make install;

In order to do this successfully you must first install PCLib and the bundles and then the application itself!
