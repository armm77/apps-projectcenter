Installing `ProjectCenter'
====================

ProjectCenter requires GNUstep to be installed. MAke sure that you have an
up to date version on your system installed!

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

GNUstep:	make install;

		If you want to do make; make install, make sure that you
		first make; make install PCLib, and *then* the rest of the
		sources!

In order to do this successfully you must first install PCLib and the bundles and then the application itself!
