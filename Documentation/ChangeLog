        * Library/PCProjectManager (openProjectAt:): get project name from 
	PC.project file instead of directory name. So project name and 
	directory name may differ.

	* Library/PCProjectLauncher.m (debug:): Debug application using 
	full path instead of "~/Application".
	
	* PCMenuController.m: disable "Tear-Off Editor Size" fields editing
	if Project Editor is not tear-off or Editor is not "ProjectCenter".
	Check only first arg of Editor value.
