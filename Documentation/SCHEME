Other (controls, tools, etc.):
------------------------------
PCButton
PCSplitView

PCBundleLoader (Used in ProjectCenter application)
PCMakefileFactory (Used in PC*Project bundles)
PCServer (don't used)

----------
TODO plan:
----------
Part I:
+ think about relations between PCMenuController and other PCProject
  descendants;
+ implement PCLaunchPanel;
+ implement PCHistoryPanel (also make PCProjectHistory be a separate);
+ implement PCInspectorPanel and move common inspectors to its suitable
  position;
+ refactor PC*Editor* family;
- implement PCProjectFinder and PCFindPanel GUI;
- make PC prefernces changes applying immediately after changing;

Part II:
- finish PCProjectBrowser;
- finish fileIcon/fileTitle;
- finish Project Inspector (interaction with PC*Project bundles);
- finish Project Builder
- finish Project Debugger (launching part, later debugging part)
- try to incorporate CodeEditor approach
- 


---------
THOUGHTS:
---------
- "Edit" menu should be completely provided by Editor part;
- "Add Files" panel should provide selection of type and "Choose Folders"
  and "Add Class", "Add Header" and so on checkbox;
- "New File in Project..." panel should provide "Create Header", 
  "Create Class" and so on checkbox. Redesign panel.
