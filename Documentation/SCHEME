------------------------------
Other (controls, tools, etc.):
------------------------------
PCButton
PCSplitView
PCOutputView (Should be implemented. Used by e.g. Project Builder)
PCBundleLoader (Used in ProjectCenter application)
PCMakefileFactory (Used in PC*Project bundles)
PCServer (don't used)

----------
THOUGHTS:
----------
- remember splitviews geometry on per project basis;
- try to incorporate CodeEditor approach
- implement PCProjectFinder and PCFindPanel GUI;

- "Edit" menu should be completely provided by Editor part;
- "Add Files" panel should provide selection of type and "Choose Folders"
  and "Add Class", "Add Header" and so on checkbox;
- "New File in Project..." panel should provide "Create Header", 
  "Create Class" and so on checkbox.
  
Localization:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- On project creation, all resources go to Resources subdir and placed into
  GNUmakefile as *_RESOURCE_FILES;
- If some file from [PC*Proj localizableKeys] categories selected as 
  "Localizable Resource", that file removed from *_RESOURCE_FILES and placed
  into *_LOCALIZED_RESOURCE_FILES (Resources->Language.lproj);
- in PC.project add LANGUAGES=();
- in PC.project add LOCALIZED_FILES=();
